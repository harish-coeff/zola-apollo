## Starting the book Systems Performance 

### Goal

- To gain practical knowledge of 

    - Operating Systems
    - File Systems
    - How memory works
    - How the CPU works
    - Networks and more...

### Methodology

- Read one chapter per week and discuss with others on what I've understood, what I've learned that was new, and what doubts I still have.
- Make Notes along the way of important topics.
- Learn markdown format, maybe explore obsidian for knowledge retrieval.
